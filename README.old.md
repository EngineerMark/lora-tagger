# LoRA-Tagger
Manage your LoRA projects with this tool. Mainly made for anime usage.


This tool is made to make selecting and tagging images for LoRA training easier.

It's made to be used with booru-like sites such as Danbooru and Gelbooru.

This is a very alpha project, it is not finished so expect bugs and what not.

This program does NOT train for you, it's helps you manage the files used for training. Use Kohya_ss GUI or something for the actual training.
